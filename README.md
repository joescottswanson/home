# Joe's Home Directory

This is my spot for keeping my dotfiles so that I can quickly clone them if I need to set
up a new machine.

##Cloning into Home (ripped off of (stilldavid)[https://github.com/stilldavid])
    cd
    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:joescottswanson/home.git
    git fetch
    git branch master origin/master
    git checkout master

The .vimrc file is largely ripped off of (brennen)[https://github.com/brennen].
